// The live settings block -- vrport.ini, re-read whenever the file's timestamp changes.
//
// Every field is `volatile` because the poll thread writes them while the render, present and
// game threads read them. That is the whole synchronisation: these are independent scalars, no
// field depends on another being updated in the same pass, and a torn read of one aligned int is
// not a state this code can observe.
//
// Hooks read this directly. That is deliberate rather than lazy -- routing forty settings through
// forty accessors buys nothing here, and the hub already exports accessors for the handful that
// cross the C ABI to the overlay.
