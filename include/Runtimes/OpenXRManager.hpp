    // period does. How many frames deep the pipeline runs is not something to reason about,

    // per present (measured), so every hundred frames or so an interval contains two pushes,
    // the count slips, and one frame gets a pose from the wrong interval -- a single visible
    // jolt roughly every couple of hundred frames. Selecting by interval collapses double

    //
    // The filter is the damaging half. adaptiveFollow with strength 0.35 follows at 1/8 per
    // cycle while the head is nearly still and at ~1.0 once it moves past ~2 deg/frame, so the
    // effective lag on the head POSITION slides between roughly 130 ms and zero as a function of

    // sub-frame phase, and the sequence of poses actually rendered comes out as
    // P1 P2 P2 P3 P5 P5 P6: occasional repeats and skips against a smoothly moving head. Each one
