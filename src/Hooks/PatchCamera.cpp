// publishes two things back: the engine's pre-write quaternion (LocateCamera's base next
// frame -- the back edge of the only real cycle here) and the write ring entry that lets
// FinalCamera identify which XR sample the frame carries.
//
// The compare-exchange on the aim epoch is not decoration: the patched instruction is
// reached from several engine job threads, so "compose once per interval" needs it to mean
// once. Two threads composing in the same interval each publish a different pose as the
// frame's pose and the last to land wins at random.
//
// INSTALL ORDER IS EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS: Locate 10, Patch 12, Final 14, all in Stage::Boot. An
// adversarial pass over the plan for this split proposed reordering Patch before Locate for a
// "single-meaning" startup signal, and the payoff does not exist: g_engineCamQuatValid is set only
// when camKind == 1, which needs ClassifyPatchCameraOwner to have self-calibrated its name offset,
// which cannot happen until MAIN's placed component passes the site. The fallback stays an ordinary
// startup transient in BOTH orders. The two windows being weighed are the gap between consecutive
// FindPattern calls inside one function -- microseconds. An unobservable change is not a safe
// change; it is an unfalsifiable one, so the order is preserved.
